## Jenkins & Docker Automation Lab
# Project Overview:
Developed and managed a Jenkins-based CI/CD pipeline in Docker containers, automating the deployment of Node.js applications and using Ansible for orchestration and configuration.

*Key Responsibilities:*

_Jenkins Master-Slave Setup_: Configured Jenkins master and slave nodes within Docker containers to run distributed CI/CD tasks, ensuring efficient load balancing across nodes.
_Pipeline Automation_: Automated the build, test, and deployment stages of a Node.js application using Jenkins pipelines, pulling source code from GitHub.
_Containerized Builds_: Leveraged Docker to containerize applications and orchestrate builds directly within Jenkins pipelines. Set up Docker agents for running build jobs inside containers.
_SSH and Secure Connections_: Set up SSH access between Jenkins master and slave containers to ensure secure communication for distributed jobs. Managed SSH key-pairs for agent execution.
_Ansible Automation_: Created and ran Ansible playbooks to install and manage Jenkins, automating tasks such as Jenkins service restart and plugin installation.
_Troubleshooting & Debugging_: Resolved challenges such as Docker socket permission issues, SSH authentication errors, and Docker build failures. Implemented solutions to ensure successful pipeline execution.
*_Key Achievements_*:

-Deployed 5+ automated CI/CD pipelines that streamlined build and deployment processes for Node.js applications.
-Reduced manual deployment time by 50% through automation.
-Solved complex Docker permission and SSH configuration issues, improving system reliability.
-Improved system scalability by setting up Jenkins slave nodes to handle additional build workloads.
